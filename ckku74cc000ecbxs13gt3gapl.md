## My Journey with the Hashnode Blog Cards 

I designed and created mockups for the cards first. 

![Capture.JPG](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612643221885/h86DX1NuR.jpeg)

Exported the final SVG from `figma`.

Gone through the documentations of `Nextjs`. 

Checked out the hashnode APIs with [https://api.hashnode.com/](https://api.hashnode.com/) and @[Sandeep Panda](@sandeep)'s blog

Created APIs to fetch the data from hashnode APIs and made the SVG content dynamic.

This is how the APIs were created after that I deployed them in vercel by importing the git repo.

Next, It was the API Playground website.

Edited Lottie Animation as per the color codes.

Then, it was all `Reactjs`. 

And Yes It also has an error page for wrong links. üòâ

## Learnings

- I have been using react for the last 2 years. And honestly, I was only using `CRA` but this is the first time I used `Nextjs` and because of that the deployment in `Vercel` was super smooth. 

- `Lottiefiles`. I used it for the first time and I loved it. I edited the animations with the [Lottie design Editor](https://lottiefiles.com/editor) and the assets in the website are from  [pixeltrue](https://www.pixeltrue.com/free-illustrations).

- We often don't do proper `code linting` on our side projects. But This time I can proudly say I did it properly. Referred to this blog [ESlint and Prettier for React apps](https://dev.to/onygami/eslint-and-prettier-for-react-apps-bonus-next-js-and-typescript-3e46)

## What is next for the `Hashnode blog Cards`

I have to enhance a few things that I already have in mind.

- PWA of the website
- Markdown and HTML syntax generator or API
- Horizontal Cards.
- more themes

This API is for the Hashnode community so Please tell me what you all will prefer next in this.
