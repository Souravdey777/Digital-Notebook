## About `Flexbox-Guide`

Flexbox-Guide is a website developed for web developers and Coding newbies learning `CSS Flexbox Layout`. This website can be used for both learning and generating the code. Simply arrange the flex items as you need and copy the CSS to your code.

Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

* Block, for sections in a webpage
    
* Inline, for text
    
* Table, for two-dimensional table data
    
* Positioned, for the explicit position of an element
    

The Flexible Box Layout Module makes it easier to design a flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

For a detailed explanation please check [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) by `Chris Coyier`

### Inspiration üí°

I got the Idea while I was explaining Flexbox to a few of the interns in my office. I was explaining to them with three empty `<div/>`s how to make responsive ui with Flexbox. And I have seen a lot of web developers using static `paddings` and `margins` and handling them with a lot of media queries. But, why go for such a mess when we have the `CSS flexbox layout`?

This tool was also created with the same thought process. So that all the budding software developers can learn Flexbox layout with an interactive tool, where you can set the attributes and check the layout as well as It will generate the CSS code for it.
